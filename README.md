Chembl
=========
Database activity fluorinated compounds and their hydrogenous analogs
------

Original csv-file is too big.
***
## Jupyter Notebook files
**Chembl.ipynb** - get a SMILES.

**dirty_Chembl.ipynb** - work with preprocessing data (without API). Loss 10% coincidence, but programm running times a few seconds.

**get_act.ipynb** - get a activities.
***
## Data
**sorted.csv** - needed columns on DataFrame (on request).

**df_train.csv** - first 100 fluorinated compounds with their characteristics.

**ID.csv** - 66300 coincidence SMILES of fluoro- and hydrohenium compounds.

**activity_train.csv** - activity of first 100 compounds and their analog.

#### Summary tables with activities will be added soon
